FIREWALLS

Network-based fws
- filters traffic by port number
- most OSI layer 4 (TCP/UDP)
- some FWs filter OSI layer 7 (Application)
- can encrypt traffic (VPN)
- can proxy traffic
- most fws can be layer 3 devices (routers)
	- usually sits on the ingress/egress of the network

Stateless fw
- does not keep track of traffic flows
- each packet examined individually
- need 2-way rule

Stateful fw (most fws today)
- remembers state of the session
- everythin within a valid flow is allowed
- single rule enough (session table)


Application-aware security devices
- OSI Application Layer (7), all data in every packet
- app layer gw, stateful multilayer inspection, deep packet inspection
- requires some advanced decodes (every packet must be analyzed and categorized)
- control traffic flows based on app (sql, twitter, youtube)

IPS
- identify app, apply app-specific vuln signatures to the traffic

Host-based FW
- work with OS to determine application

Firewall rules
- ACL (Access Control Lists)
- allow/disallow traffic based on tuples
- logical path, usually top-to-bottom
- can be generic or very specific
- Implicit deny, most FWs include a deny at the bottom

VPN Concentrators

-often integrated into a FW
-client software and often build in OS
-SSL VPN(secure socket layer)
	-tcp443, no req for digital cert like IPSec, from browser of light client
-full tunnel means all traffic goes
-split tunnel, some traffic not in tunnel
-site-to-site VPN, almost always on
-IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)
	- security for OSI Layer 3 (auth and encryption for every packet)
	- confidentiality and integrity/anti-replay (encryption and packet signing)
	- standardized, multi-vendor possible
	- two core IPSec protocols (Authentication Header, Ecapsulation Security Payload) AH and ESP
		- AH, hash of the packet and a shared key (md5, sha1,sha2)
		- ESP, encrypts the packet, md5/sha1/2 for hash, 3DES/AES for encryption

---

NIDS NIPS

-watch network traffic for exploits, buffer overflows, XSS and other vuln
-Passive monitoring
	-examine copy of the traffic, port mirror (SPAN), network tap, can't block
-Out-of-band response, when malicious traffic identified, IPS sens TCP RST frame > limits traffic
-Inline monitoring
	-IDS/IPS sits physically inline > all traffic through it
-In-band response > bad traffic dropped at IPS before reaching network
-Identification technologies
	-signature based, look for perfect match
	-anomaly based, builds baseline of normal
	-behavior based, observe and report
	-heurestic, use AI to identify
-IPS rules
	-determine what happens to bad traffic (block,allow,alert,etc.)
	-thousands of rules, can be customized by group or individual
	-takes time find balance between sec/alert noise/fp
-False Positives
	-report that isn't true, false alarm
	-IDS/IPS information
		-only as good as the signatures
		-legit traffic could be marked as malicious
		-time-consuming to research and resolve
-False Negative
	-report missed identifying something
	-malicious traffic goes through, completely silent

Router and Switch Security

Routers

-Routes traffic between IP subnets
-OSI layer 3 device
-routers inside switches called "layer3 switch"
- Layer2 = switch, Layer 3 = router
- connects diverse network types: LAN,WAN,copper,fiber
ACLs
-allow/deny traffic, also used for NAT,QoS,etc.
-defined on incoming or outgoing interface
-evaluate criterias: source/dest IP, port numbers etc.
Anti-spoofing
-prevent MitM, DDoS, etc.
- filter reserved IPs
- RPF, Reverse Path Forwarding
	- response to an inbound packed should return the same way
	- if not, drop the packet

Switches

-bridgin done in hardware, Application-specifi integrated circuit (ASIC)
-OSI layer 2 device, many ports (core of network), high bandwidth

Switch port security
-inside network relatively insecure VS outside
-NAC (Network Access Control)
	-IEEE 802.1X - Port-based NAC
		- dont get access until authentication
		- makes use of EAP and RADIUS (Extensible Auth Protocol / Remote Auth Dial in User Service)
	-physical interfaces (not tcp/udp ports)
	-admin should disable unused ports
	- duplicate MAC address check, stop spoofers

Loop prevention
-connect two switches to each other
-they'll send traffic back and forth forever
-brings network down
-Spanning Tree Protocol, IEEE standard 802.1D prevents loops in bridged (switched) networks

Flood guard
-configure a max/specific numb of source MAC addresses on interface
-maintains a list of every source mac address, once exceeds maximum > port sec activates, interface usually disabled by default

Layer 3 switches
-swtich (layer 2) and router (layer 3) in the same physical device

---

Proxies

-Sits between users and external network (Inet mostly)
-receives user req and sends it on their behalf
-caches info, access control, URL filter, content scan
-some proxies invisible (transparent)
-apps may need to know (setup) how to use the proxy (explicit)

Application proxies
- NAT, a network-level proxy
- most proxies are app proxies
- proxy may know only one app, HTTP
- many are multipurpose proxies (HTTP,HTTPS,FTP,etc)

Forward proxy
-internal proxy, commonly used to protect and control user acces to Inet

Reverse proxy
-inbound traffic from Inet to your internal service
	- Inet --- Proxy --- web server

Open proxy
-3rd-party,uncontrolled proxy
-can be sec concern
-often used to circumvent existing sec controls

---

Load Balancers

-distribute the load on multiple servers, invisible to end-user
-large-scale implementations: web server farms, db farms
-fault tolerance, server outages have no effect, fast convergence
-configurable load, manage across servers
-TCP,SSL offload
-caching,prioritization,content switching

Scheduling
-Round-robin, each server selected in turn
-weighted, prioritize server use
-dynamic, monitor server load > use lowest
-Affinity
	-many app require communication to same instance
	-user "stuck" to the same server
	-tracked through IPs,sessions IDs
^active/active load balancing

Active/passive load balancing
-some servers active, some on standby
-if active fails, passive takes it place

Access Points / WAP (Wireless access point)

- not a wireless router, wireless router is a router and a AWP in single device
- WAP is a bridge, OSI layer 2 device, extends wired network onto wireless network

SSID management (Service Set Identifier)
-name of the wireless network
-disabling SSID broadcasting is more security through obscurity than actual security

MAC filtering
-Media Access Control, the harware address
-keep unwanted devices out
	-MAC easy to spoof
	-again security through obscurity - no security at all

Power level controls
-power of the signal, not too much, not too little

Band selection and bandwidths
- Throughput, maximum theoretical, may vary
- 2,4 and 5GHz
- channel, differences in geo location

Omnidirectional antennas
-most common, signal evenly distributed on all sides, omni=all
-good choise for most, but cant focus signal
Directional antennas
-focus the signal for increased distances
-send/receive in single direction, focused transmission
-antenna preformance measured in dBs
-Yagi antenna, very directional and high gain
-Parabolic antenna, focus the signal to a single point

Wireless LAN controllers
- centralized management
- deploy new APS, performance/sec monitoring, reports
- configure changes to all sites
- usually proprietary system (Ubiquiti, Cisco), control paired with APs

Managing wireless configurations
-LWAPP - Lightweight Access Point Protocol
- Cisco proprietary, CAPWAP is RFC standard, based on LWAPP
-manage multiple APs simultaneously

Thick/fat AP
-AP handles most wireless task, switch is not wireless-aware
Thin AP
-just enough to be 802.11 wireless
-intelligence in switch, less expensive

---

SIEM

-Security Information and Event Management
-logging security events and information
-log aggregation and long-term storage
-data correlation, link diverse data types
-SOC, forensic analysis
-time syncing critical for log sources - use NTP, very accurate
-SYSLOG
	-standard for message logging (diverse systems, consolidated log)
-WORM drive technology - Write Once Read Many
-Event de-duplication, filter out the noise, focus on real problems
-constant information flow > track,alert,responses


---

Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
-stop data "leakage" before hackers get it

DLP systems
-on your pc, endpoint dlp
-on your network, data in motion
-on your server, data at rest
-USB blocking f.e.
	-DLP on PC, allow or deny certain tasks

Cloud-based DLP
-located between users and inet
-watch every byte of traffic, no hw/software
-manage access to URLs, block file transfer to cloud storage
-block virus/malware

DLP and email
-most critical risk vector, inbound threats and outbound data loss
-check every email
-inbound: block keywords / pihsihing / quarantine emails
-outbound: fake wire transfers, W-2 transmission, employee info

---

Network Access Control

Edge vs access control

Control at the edge
-your inet link, primary FW rules

Access control
-conrtol from where you are (inside or outside)
-access based on many rules: user,group, location,app etc.
-access easily revoked or changed

Posture assessment
-can't trust every device
	- BYOD
	- malware infection / missing AV
	- unauthorized apps
-before connecting to network, perform health check
	- is it trusted device?
	- running AV? updated?
	- corp app installed?
	- mobile device? disk encrypted?

Health checks/posture assessment
-Persisten agents
	-permanently installed onto system, updates may be required
-Dissolvable agents
	-no installation, runs during posture assessment, terminates when no need
-Agentless NAC
	-integrated with Active Directory, check made during login/logoff
	-cant be scheduled

Failing your assessment
- too dangerous to allow access
- put to quarantine networks, notify admin
- just enough network access to fix the issue
- once resolved (like AV updated), try again

Mail Gateways

-unsolicited email	
	-stop it at gateway before reaches user
	-on-site or cloud-based
-email filtering, inbound/outbound
-block spam, modify phishing links
-anti-virus, block bad attachments
-DLP (Data Loss Prevention), block confidential info in emails

Identifying spam
- whitelist, only receive from trusted
- SMTP standards checking, block if not following standards
- rDNS - reverse DNS, block if senders domain doesn't match IP
- Tarpitting, intentionally slow down server conversation
- recipient filtering, if not valid address > block

Email encryption
- almost all mail not encrypted
- email encryption not always seamless
- encryption can be required on the gateway
	- based on policy, force encryption, send PW to recipient via txt msg
- many email clients support encryption

---

Other Security Devices

SSL accelerators
-asymmetric encryption (like SSL handshake) is hard, need CPU power
-offload the handshake process to different hw (ssl offload, ssl termination)
-symmetric convo continues, but may not be encrypted between accelerator and the web server

SSL/TLS decryption
- used commonly to examine outgoing SSL
- browser contains list of trusted CAs
- with SSL proxy, Internal CA in devices and FW (SSL decryptor)

Hardware Security Module (HSM)
- High-end cryptographic hw
- plug-in card or separate hw
- key backup, secured storage
- offload cpu overhead from other devices

Media gateways
- Converts between PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) and VoIP
- ISDN trunk here, Ethernet with VoIP there
- Sec significant concern
	- disable all voice comm
 	- listen to comms, spam calls
