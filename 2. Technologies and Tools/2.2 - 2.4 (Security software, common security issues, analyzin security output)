2.2 SECURITY SOFTWARE

SOFTWARE SECURITY TOOLS

Passive security
- watch packets go by
- lot to learn
- top talkers, servers, clients, apps, OSs, services

Active security
- send traffic to device, watch results
- query login page
- try known vuln, check account access

Protocol analyzer
- solve complex app issues, get into details
- gathers packets on network
- view traffic patterns, identify unknown traffic, verify filtering
- large scale storage, big data analytics

Network scanners
- active - scan IPs/ports, OSs, services etc.
- visually map the network, find rogue systems (difficult to hide from a layer 2 ARP)

Wireless scanners and crackers
- wireless monitoring, packet capturing
- wireless attacks, check death attacks etc.
- cracking, how easy to crack your wifi key

PW crackers
- pw stored as hash, one-way trip
- some stored without complexity
	- easy to brute-force a weak hash
- get hashes > use wordlist, rainbow tables etc.

Vulnerability scanners
- check if you missed sec patch
- minimally invasive, but active (not like pentest)
- gather much info as possible, prioritize after
- Tenable Nessus etc..

Configuration compliance scanners
- devices meet minimum sec confs?
	- need to comply with internal req or industry regulations
- check fo varios confs (OS version, installed apps, network settings, AV etc.)
- auditing may be ongoing
	- report current status, identify changes over time
	- integrated with login process / VPN connection

Exploitation frameworks
- many opportunities for exploits: browser, OS, app, embedded devices..
- don't invent the wheel, use frameworks
	- BeEf - The Browser Exploitation Framework Project
	- RouterSPloit - Router Exploitation Framework
	- Metasploit - Build your own or use modules in existing exploit db

Data sanitization tools
- overwrite data on old HDD
	- can overwrite whole drive or one file

Steganography tools
-	"concealed writing", security through obscurity
- network based, embed msg in TCP packets
- use image, embed msg in image itself
- invisible watermark, yellow dots on printers (serial numb and timestamp)

Honeypots
- Attract the bad guys and trap them there
- create virtual world to explore
- must be real enough

Backup utilities
- protect from unexpected downtime (malware infection, ransomware, server defacement etc.)
- realtime file sync, rsync
- regular partial backups
- full backups, complete file backups / system images
- complete coverage / fast recovery

Banner grabbing
- apps can be chatty, sometimes say too much
- banner is always there, usually behind the scenes
- can be captured by nc, nmap etc.

COMMAND LINE SECURITY TOOLS

ping
- test connectivity, determine round-trip time
- Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
- 1st troubleshoot, can you ping the host?

netstat
-network statistics
- "netstat -a" show all active connections
- "netsat -b" show binaries (Win)
- "netstat -n" , do not resolve names

traceroute
- determine route a packet takes to destination
- map entire path
- tracert (win), traceroute (POSIX)
- takes advantage of ICMP Time to Live Exceeded error msg
- TTL refers to hops, not time
- TTL=1 first router, TTL=2 second router etc
- not all devices reply with ICMP, some FW filter

nslookup and dig
- lookup info from DNS servers (canonical name, IP, cache timers)
- "nslookup" win and unix, lookup names and IPs
- dig (Domain Information Groper)
	- more advanced domain info

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- determine MAC address based on IP address
- you need hw address to communicate
- "arp -a" view local ARP table

ipconfig and ifconfig
- most troubleshooting starts with your IP address
- determine TCP/IP and network adapter info

tcpdump
- capture packets from cli
- available on most unix/linux/macos, Win has "WinDumb"
- aplly filters in real time, save data, use in another app (wireshark), written in standard pcap format

Nmap
- network mapper, port/OS/service scan, additional scripts

netcat (ncat)
- "read" or "write" to the network
- open a port and send or receive some traffic
- listen on a port, transfer data, scan ports
- become a backdoor

--------

2.3 COMMON SECURITY ISSUES

Unecrypted credentials
- auth is critical process, must be protected
- some protocols arent encrypted (telnet, FTP, SMTP,IMAP)
- verify with packet capture

Logs and event anomalies
- gather as much info as possible
- many sources: switch, router, fw, servers, ips, av
- use SIEM to consolidate logs and correlate data, reports

Permission issues
- simple oversight, huge vulnerability
- door was left open, no need to lockpick
- confirm permissions on initial conf
	- periodic audits

Access violations
- segmentation fault, OS prevents access to restricted area of memory
- might be programming error, security issue, DoS

Certificate issues - Trust
- a cert should be signed by trusted party
- certs should be relatively new
- apps must perform the proper cert checks
	- if not, it's easy to MitM attack

Data exfiltration
- data is your most valuable asset, also mb to other people

Misconfigured devices
- "open door"
- default usrname/pw left on
- outdate software, known vulns
- running debug/maintenance code
- FW rules provide too much access, can be difficult to audit
- content filters, URL's not specific enough, some protocols not filtered
- Access Points, no encryption, open confs

Weak security configurations
- Too old encryption, like DES, easy to bruteforce
- Encryption vulns, like WEP
- weak hash, SHA-1, many hash collisions

Personnel issues
- weakest link, people make mistakes
- Policy violations, it's in your Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
- Insider threats, auth users have more free reign
	- important to assign correct rights/permissions
- Social Engineering, people like to help
- Social media, posting internal info, many orgs have policy
- personal emails

Unauthorized software
- may conflict with orgs mission-critical software
- could be malicious
- licensing
- ongoing support (security patches, updates)

Baseline deviation
- everything should be documented
	- hw, software, network traffic patterns, data storage
- changes to norm should be identified (alerts)
- common with VPNs
	- before connecting, check baseline (av, updates)

License compliance violation
- OS, apps, HW appliances - all use different methods
- availability, expiration may cause problems
- integrity, data and apps must be accurate and complete
	- may cause problems with data integrity

Asset management
- Identify and track computing assets (usually automated)
- respond faster to sec problem
- keep eye on valuable assets
- track licenses
- verify all devices up to date

Authentication issues
- papers, please
- number of factors, more the better, more chance of problems
- lapse in authentication can open entire network

2.4 Analyzing Security Output

Host-based IDS/IPS
- used to be separate app, now integrated to EPP
- protect based on signatures, decrypted data
- protect based on activity, why are you modifying that data?

AV
-will alert on virus or bad URL, logs it

File integrity check
- OS check, original files in place?

Host-based FW
- protect against other on network, restrict access to your personal computer
- required for laptops, mobile devices
- restrict by app and port, logs attempts

App whitelisting
- decision made in the OS
- often muilt-in to OS management
- app hash, only allow aps with correct hash
- certificate, only digitally signed apps from certain publisher
- path, only app in these folders
- network zone, apps can only run from this network zone

Removable media
- USB drives, portable hard drives (bane of the security)
- malware infections, unknown USB drives
- exfiltration, terabytes of data fits in your pocket
- view USB media use, log filenames that are copied

Advanced malware tools
- specialized removal and recovery tools
- malware is pervasive
- best recovery is to delete and restore from backup

Patch management tools

UTM / All-in-one security appliance
- Unified Threat Management (UTM) / Web security gateway
- URL filter / content/malware inspection, spam filter, CSU/DSU, router, switch, fw, ids/ips, bandwidth shaper, vpn endpoint

Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- social sec numbers, cc numbers, medical records
- stop data leakage

Data Execution Prevention (DEP)
- no-eXecute bit
	- Intel XD bit (eXecute Disable)
	- AMD Enhacned Virus Protection
- code can't run from protected memory locations
- prevents malware from executing
- Windows DEP logs in Event Viewer

Web application firewall (WAF)
- not like a normal FW, applies rules on HTTP/HTTPS conversations
- allow/deny on expected input
- protect from SQL injection
- major focus on Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
