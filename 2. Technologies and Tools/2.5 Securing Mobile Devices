Mobile Device Connection Methods

cellular networks
-sec concerns: traffic/location monitoring
-wifi: local sec problems as other wifi devices

SATCOM - Satellite communications
-remote locations, natural disasters
-literally talking to space (low earth orbit or geostationary)
-voice and data comms
-handheld can be sec risk (same as mobile)

NFC - near field communication
-remote capture, 10m active
-freq jamming, replay/relay attack

ANT/ANT+
- wireless sensor network protocol
- 2.4 GHz ISM band (industrial, scientific and medical)
- IoT ultra-low-power protocol
- fitness devices, heart rate monitors etc.
- separate wireless service, not 802.11/bluetooth
- optional encryption, no method to maintain integrity

IR (Infrared)
- phones, tablets, smartwatches, entertainment cetner
- file transfer possible

USB (Universal Serial Bus)
- usb to PC, Lightning
- physical access always a concern

Mobile Device Management (MDM)


- Centralized mngmt of the mobile devices
- set policies on data, app, camera etc.
- control remote device, entire device or "partition"
- manage access contrtol: force screen lock / PINs

-Application management
	-challenging, some are malicious
	-some orgs manage through whitelists, new apps must be checked and added

-Mobile Content Management (MCM)
- secure access to data
- file sharing and viewing: on-site (file server, sharepoint), cloud-based (box, O365)
-DLP prevents copy/paste sensitive data

-Remote wipe (remember backup)

-Geofencing
	-restrict/allow features when device in particular area
	-camera might only work outside office
	-authentication allowed only in particular area

Context-aware authenticaction
-Combine multiple contexts
	-where you normally login (IP)
	-frequent (GPS info)
	-other devices (bluetooth pair)
-emerging technology

Containerization
- difficult to separate personal/business
	- specially if BYOD
- separate enterprise mobile apps/data
	- virtual "container" for company data
	- storage segmentation keps data separate

Full device encryption
-key often backed up on the MDM

Mobile Device Enforcement 


-Third-party app stores
	-MDM can allow/deny app store use

Rooting/jailbreaking
- Mobile dev are purpose-built systems, no need to access OS
- MDM becomes useless, circumvent sec features, sideload apps

Carrier unlocking
- most phones locked to carrier
- unlocking may be illegal

Firmware OTA updates (Over-the-Air)
- OS gets updates on the air
- MDM can manage what OTA updates allowed

Camera
- use can be limited by MDM

SMS/MMS
-short message service / multimedia messaging service
-outobund data leaks, phishing attempts

USB OTG (On-the-Go)
- connect mobile devices directly together

Mic (recording)
- legal liability

Geotagging / GPS tagging
- adds your location to document metadata
- can track user quite easily

WiFi Direct/ad hoc
- connect wireless devices directly, no need for AP
- simplicity can aid vulns (invisible access to device)

Hotspot/tethering
- may turn your phone in to rogue AP > access to internal network

Mobile Device Deployment Models

BYOD
-difficult to secure since personal/work use

COPE (Corporate Owned, Personally enabled)
- org buys device, used for work and personal
- similiar to company-owned workstations
- information protected using corp policies
- CYOD (Choose Your Own device)
	- like COPE, but you choose device

Corporate owned
- org owns/controls device
- no personal use, cant mix home/business
- specific sec req

VDI/VMI
- virtual desktop/mobile infrastructure
- apps /data are separated from mobile device
- data stored securely, cetralized
- physical device loss risk is minimized
- centralized app development (write for single VMI platform)
- apps managed centrally
