Voice and video
- SRTP - secure real-time transport protocol / Secure RTP
- encryption, uses AES
- auth, integrity and replay protection
	- HMAC-SHA1 - hash-based message auth code using SHA1

Time syncing
- NTP has no sec features
	- exploited as amplifiers in DDoS attacks
-NTPsec, secure time protocol

Email
- S/MIME - Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
- public key encryption and digital signing
- secure POP and IMAP
	- use STARTTLS extension, to use SSL
- SSL/TLS
	- if mail is browser based

Web
-SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/ Transport Layer Security)
-uses public key encryption
	- private key on the server
	- symmetric session key trasferred using asymmetric encryption
	- sec and speed

File transfer
- FTPS
	- FTP over SSL, File Trasfer Protocol Secure
	- this is not SFTP
- SFTP
	- SSH File Transfer Protocol
	- provides file system functionality, resume interrupted transfers, dir list, remote file removal

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
- protocol for reading/writing directories over an IP network
- X.500 written by ITU - International Telecom Union
 - used in Win AD, Apple OpenDirectory, OpenLDAP etc.

LDAPS (LDAP Secure)
- non-standard implementation of LDAP over SSL
SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer)
- provides auth using many diff methods, i.e. Kerberos or client cert


DNS - Domain Name Resolution
- no security, easy to poison
- DNSSEC- DNS Security Extension
	- validate DNS responses (origin auth, data integrity)	
	- Public key cryptography
		- dns records signed with trusted 3rd-party, published in DNS

SNMPv3 - Simple Network Management Protocol version 3
	- Confidentiality - encrypted data
	- Integrity - No tampering of data
	- Authentication - Verifies the source

DHCP
- no built-in sec, no sec version
- rogue DHCP servers
	- in AD, dhcp servers must be authorized
	- some switch can be configured with "trusted" interface
	- dhcp only allowed from trusted interfaces
	- Cisco calls this DHCP Snooping
- dhcp client DoS - starvation attack
	- use spoofed MAC addresses to exhaust dhcp pool
	- switch can be confed to limit the number of MAC addresses per interface

Subscription services
- Automated subscriptions
- AV, IPS, FW signature updates
- constant updates, different methods
- Check for encryption and integrity checks
	- may req additional public key conf
	- set up trust relationship (certs, IPs)
