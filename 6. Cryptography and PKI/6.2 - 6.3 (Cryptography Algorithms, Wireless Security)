6.2 Cryptography Algorithms

Symmetric Algorithms

DES (Data Encryption Standard)
- DES and Triple DES
- dev 1972-1977 by IBM for NSA
- 64-bit block cipher
	- 56-bit key, easily brute-forced today

3DES (Triple DES)
- three different keys 
	- two separate keys is deprecated, single key isn't allowed
- Use DES three times
	- encrypt with first key
	- decrypt with second
	- encrypt with third
- superseded by AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)
- Ron Rivest
- Part of ill-fated WEP standard
- also part of SSL, but removed from TLS
- RC4 has "biased output"
	- if third byte is zero, and the second byte is not equal to two, then second output byte is always zero
- not common these days, WPA2 moved to AES

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
- US Federal Gov Standard
- it took 5 years to standardize
- 128-bit block cipher
	- 128, 192 and 256-bit keys
- used in WPA2

Blowfish and Twofish
- Blowfish, by Bruce Schneier
	- 64-bit block cipher, variable length key (1 to 448 bits)
	- no known way to break the full 16 rounds of encryption
	- one of the first secure ciphers, not limited by patents
- Twofish, successor to Blowfish
	- 128-bit block size, key sizes up to 256
	- no patent, public doamin

Block Cipher Models

Block cipher mode of operation
- encrypt one fixed-length group of bits at a time (a block)
- mode of operation
	- defines the method of encryption
	- may provide a method of authentication
- block size is a fixed size
	- not all data matches block size
	- split your plaintext into smaller blocks	
	- some modes req padding before encrypting

ECB (Electronic Codebook)
- simplest encryption mode, too simple for most use cases
- each block is encrypted with same key
	- identical plaintext block create identical ciphertext blocks

CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
- popular mode of operation, easy to implement
- each plaintext block is XORed with previous ciphertext block
	- adds additional randomization
	- use an intialization vector for the first block

CTR (Counter)
- block cipher mode / acts like a streamer cipher
	- encrypts successive values of a "counter"
- plaintext can be any size, since it's part of the XOR

GCM (Galois/Counter Mode)
- encryption with authentication
	- auth part of the block mode
	- combines Counter Mode with Galois authentication
- minimum latency, minimum operation overhead
	-very efficient encryption/authentication
- commonly used in packetized data (wireless, IPsec, SSH, TLS)

Asymmetric Algorithms

Diffie-Hellman key exchange
- key exchange method over insecure comm channel
- pub in 1976
- DH does not itself encrypt or authenticate
	- anonymous key-agreement protocol
- used for PFS
	- Ephermal Diffie-Hellman (EDH or DHE)
	- combine with elliptic curve crypto fo ECDHE
- uses asymmetric crypto to create symmetric key

RSA (Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, Leonard Adelman)
- pub in 1977
- first practival public-key crypto system
	- encrypt, decrypt, digital signtatures
- based on the product of 2 large prime numbers
	- you must know the factors to decode
- now released into the public domain	
	- used extensiverly for web site encryption and digital rights mngmt

DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)
- standard for digital signatures
	- modifies DA 
- combine with elliptic curve crypto
	- fast/efficient digital signatures
- ECDSA - Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm

ECC - Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- used for encryption, digital sign, pseudo-random generators
- instead of numbers, use curves
	- use smaller keys than non-ECC encryption

PGP and GPG
- popular asymmetric encryption
- commercial software (Symantec)
- Open standard - OpenPGP
	- implemented as sw Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG)

Hashing Algorithms

MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm)
- pub in 1992, replaced MD4
- 1996 vulns found, hash collision

SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)
- dev by NSA
- SHA-1, widely used, 160-bit digest, 2005 hash collision
- SHA-2, up to 5012-bit digest, preferred SHA variant

HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)
- combine hash with a secret key, e.g. HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA1
- verify data integrity and authenticity
- used in network encryption protocols like IPsec, TLS

RIPEMD (RACE Integrity Primitives Evaluation Message Digest)
- RACE - Research and Development in Advanced Communications Technologies in Europe
- family of message digest algorithms
- centralized crypto standards and management
- original RIPEMD found collision issue in 2004
	- replaced with RIPEMD-160
	- based upon MD4 but performs similiar to SHA-1

Key Stretching Algorithms

Weak key can be made stronger by hashing a pw, hashing the hash etc.

Libraries
- already built for your app, no additional programming needed
- bcrypt
	- generates shas from pw, uses Blowfish cipher for multiple rounds of hashing
- Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2)
	- part of RSA public key crypto standards

---

Obfuscation

XOR (Exclusive OR) cipher
- outputs true when inputs differ
- used extensively in cryptography
	- with truly random key, results are theoretically unbreakable

Substitution ciphers
- simple substitution A is D etc.
- Caesar cipher
	- substitute one letter with another at a fixed position
- can be hacked with frequency analysis or brute force

ROT13 (Rotate by 13 places)
- commonly found in online forums
	- obfuscate spoilers

6.3 Wireless Security

Wireless Cryptographic Protocols

Wireless encryption
- all wireless devices are radio transmitters/receivers
- anyone can listen in, need to encrypt data
- only people with PW can transmit/listen (WPA/WPA2)

WPA (Wifi Protecte Access)
- 2002 replaced WEP

TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol)
- combines secret root key with the IV
- adds sequence counter to prevent replay attacks
- implements 64-bit Message Integrity Check, protect against tampering
- TKIP has vulns, deprecated standard

WPA2 and CCMP
- began in 2004
- AES replaced RC4, CCMP (Counter Mode with Cipher block Chaining) replaced TKIP
- CCMP
	- uses AES for data confidentiality
	- 128-bit key and 128-bit block size
	- req additional comp resources
- CCMP security devices
	- data confidentiality, authentication, access control

Wireless Authentication Protocols

EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)
- framework
- many diff ways to authenticate
- WPA/WPA2 use five EAP types as authentication mechanisms

EAP-FAST (EAP Flexible Authentication via Secure Tunneling)
- Cisco's proposal to replace LEAP (used with WEP)
- light, secure

EAP-TLS
- strong sec, wide adoption
- support from most of the industry

EAP-TTLS (EAP Tunneled TLS)
- support any  other auth protocols in a TLS tunnel

PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol)
- protected EAP
- by MS, Cisco, RSA Security
- encapsulates EAP in a TLS tunnel, one cert on the server
- commonly implemented as PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2

802.1X
- IEEE 802.1X - port based network access control (NAC)
- used in conjunction with an access db
	- RADIUS, LDAP, TACACS+

RADIUS Federation
- members of one org can auth to the network of another org
- use normal creds
- 802.1X as auth method, RADIUS on the backend, EAP to authenticate

Wireless Security

Wireless security modes
- open system - no auth pw required
- WPA-Personal / WPA-PSK
	- WPA2 with pre-shared key
	- everyone uses the same 256-bit key
- WPA-Enterprise /WPA-802.1X
	- auth users with auth server (i.e. RADIUS)

Captive portal
- auth to a network, common on wireless networks
- access table recognizes lack of auth
	- redirects your web access to captive portal page
- username / pw
- once proper auth provided, web session continues

Using WPS (wifi protected setup)
- "wifi simple config"
- "easy" setup for mobile device
	- pin, nfc, usb, push a button
- ez hackable
