4.3 IDENTITY AND ACCESS CONTROLS

Access Control Models

Authorization
- process of ensuring only authorized rights are exercised - policy enforcement
- process of determining rigthts - policy definiton
- user receives rights based on Access Control models
	- different business needs or mission requirements

Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
- OS limits the operation on an object
	- based on security clearance levels
- every objenct gets a label
	- confidential, secret, top secret etc.
- labeling of object uses predefined rules
	- admin decides who gets access to what sec level
	- users cannot change these settings

Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
- used in OS, familiar access control model
- you create a spdreadsheet
	- as owner, you control who has access
	- you can modify access at any time
- flexible but weak security

Role-based access control (RBAC)
- you have a role in org (manager, director, team lead..)
- admin provides access based on the role of user
	- rights gained impocitly insted of explicitly
- in Win, user Groups to provide role-based access control
	- you in shipping/receiving, can use shipping sw
	- you manager, can alswo view shipping logs

Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- users can have complex relationships to apps/data
	- may be based on many different criteria
- can consider many parameters (next-gen authorization model)
- aware of context
- combine/evaluate multiple parameters
	- resource info, IP, time, action, etc.

Rule-based access control
- generic term for following urles
- access determined through system-enforced rules by admins
- rule associated with object, system check the ACL for that object
- rule examples:
	- lab network access available from 9-5
	- only chrome may complete this web form

File system security
- part of most OS
- access control list, group/user rights/permissions, can be centrally managed and/or user manage files they own
- encryption can be built-in

Database security
- own type of access control (username, pw, permissions)
- most DB support data encryption
- data integrity usually an option
	- no data is lost bcs of fault
	- part of the db server operation
- apps can provide secure front-end
	- prevent SQL inj. and inappropriata access to data

Access Control Technologies

Proximity cards
- close range cards, contactless smart cart
- passive device, no power in card, powered from reader
- not a large data storage device
	- often used as identifier which is linked to data stored elsewhere

Smart cards
- integrated circuit card, contact or contactless
- common on credit cards, also used for access control
- must have physical card to provide digital access, digital cert
- multiple factors, use the card with PIN/fingerprint

Biometric factors
- fingerprint scanner: phone, door, laptop
- retinal: unique capillary structure in the back of the eye
- iris: texture, colour
- voice recognition: talk for access
- facial: shape of face and features

Biometric acceptance rates
- False acceptance rate (FAR)
	- likelihood that an unauthorized user will be accepted, bad
- False rejection rate (FRR)
	- likelihood that an authorized user will be rejected, try again
- Crossover error rate (CER)
	- the rate at which FAR and FRR are equal
	- adjust sensitivity to equalize both values
	- used to quantitatively compare biometric systems

Token generatos
- pseudo-random token generators: useful authentication factor
- carry physical hw token generator
- use sw-based token generator on you phone

HOTP
- one-time pw, never again
- once a session, once each auth attempt
- HMAC-based One-Time Password algorithm
	- keyed-hash message authentication code (HMAC)
	- keys based on a secret key and counter
- Token-based auth
	- hash is different every time
- HW and SW tokens available, need additional technology to make this work

TOTP
- Time-based One-Time Password algorithm
- use secret key and time of day, no incremental counter
- secret key is configured ahead of time, timestamp synced via NTP
- timestamp usually increments every 30 sec
- common OTP method, used by google, fb, MS etc.

Certificate-based authentication
- smart card, private key is on the card
- PIV (Personal Identity Verification) card
	- US Federal Gov smart card
	- pic and identification info
- CAC (Common Access Card)
	- US DoD smart card, pic/identity info
- IEEE 802.1X
	- gain access to network using a cert
	- on device storage or separate physical device
