4. IDENTITY AND ACCESS MANAGEMENT

4.1

AAA and Authentication

AAA framework
	- identification, this is who you claim to be (usually username)
	- authentication, prove you are why you are (pw and others)
	- authorization, based on your id and auth, what access do you have?
	- accounting, resources used: login time, data sent/received, logout time

Multi-factor authentication
- something you have, have, know, are, do
- can be expensive: separate tokens, specialized scanning equipment
- can be inexpensive: free smartphone apps

Something you are
- biometric authentication: figerprin, iris scan, voiceprint

Something you have
- smart card, usb token, hw/sw tokens, your phone

Something you know
- PW, PIN (personal identification number), pattern

Somewhere you are
- provide a factor based on your location
- transaction only completes if you are in particular geography
- IP address: not perfect, works with ipv4, not ipv6
- mobile device with geolocation better, but not perfect

Something you do
- handwriting, typing technique
- similiar to biometrics


Federation
- provide network access to others, like partners, suppliers etc.
- third-parties can establish a federated network
	- authenticate and authorize between two orgs (login with your FB)
- 3rd-parties must establish a trust relationship, and degree of trust

Single sign-on (SSO)
- authenticate one time, access everything
- saves time, seamless process
- different methods: Kerberos, 3rd-party methods

Transitive trust
- trust relationships need to be established early
	- difficult to change once in place
- one-way trust: domain B trust A, A doesnt trust B
- two-way trust: both trust each other equally
- non-transitive trust: trust applies to that domain
- transitive trust: if domain A trusts B, B trusts C, then A trusts C

4.2 IDENTITY AND ACCESS SERVICES

RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service)
- common AAA protocol, supported widely by HW and OS
- centralize authentication for users
	- routers, switches, FWs, server authentication, remote VPN, 802.1X

TACACS (Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System)
- remote authentication protocol
- created to control access to dial-up lines to ARPANET

XTACACS (Extended TACACS)
- ptoprietary vesrion of TACACS, Cisco-created
- additional support for accounting and auditing

TACACS+
- latest version of TACACS, not backward compatible
- more authentication req/respond codes
- released as open standard in 1993

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
- protocol for reading/writing directories over IP network
- TCP/UDP ports 389
- windows AD, apple opendirectory etc.

X.500 Distinguished names
- attribute=value pairs
- most specific attribute is listed first > easy to build info tree
- hierarchical structure
- container objects (country, org, OU)
- leaf objects (users, computers, files, printers)

Microsoft NTLM
- windows only challenge/response: domain name, username, pw hash
- LAN Manager (LANMAN): MS and 3Com network OSs
- NT LAN Manager v2
	- hash challenge (similiar to CHAP)
	- somewhat insecure, like old hash algo
- some Win pw db contain LM hash > vuln to forwarding attack
- migrate to Kerberos if not already

Kerberos
- Network authentication protocol
- auth once, trusted by the system, no need to re-auth on everything
- mutual authentication - the client and the server (protect against MitM)
- Standard since 1980s, developed by MIT
- MS started using Kerbor in Windows 2000
	- based on Kerbero 5.0 open standard
	- compatible with other OS and devices

SSO with Kerberos
- authenticate one time
	- lots of backend ticketing
	- cryptographic tikest
	- save time, but only works with Kerberos

PAP, CHAP and MS-CHAP

PPP authentication
- Point-to-Point Protocol
	- analog dialup, ISDN
PPTP (... Tunneling)
PPPoE (... over Ethernet) - DLS authentication
- need to authenticate through non-ethenet networks (PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP)

PAP (Password Authentication Protcol)
- basic authentication method
- used in legacy systems
- rare to see singularly used
- weak authentication shceme
- non-encrypted, bcs not required on analog dialup lines

CHAP (Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol)
- encrypted challenge sent over the network
- three-way handshake
	- after link is established, server sends challenge message, client responds with a password hash (calculated from challenge and pw), server compares received hash with stored
- challenge-response occurs periodically during connection

MS-CHAP (Microsofts implemention of CHAP)
- commonly used on MS PPTP, MS-CHAP v2 more recent version
- sec issues related to the use of DES
	- easy to bruteforce
	- don't use MS-CHAP
	- consider secure VPN technology

Federated Identities

Server-based authentication
- HTTP/web browser communication is stateless
- each req is unique and no relationship to prev req
- traditionally server has kept track of logins
	- you get sessionID when login
- adds overhead to the server
	- difficult to scale and manage across multiple devices
	- adds challenges with redundancy and cloud services

Token-based authentication
- no session info is stored on the server, stateless 
- after user authenticates, app sends token to client, stored locally
- token is provided with each req on the server, which is validated by server

Federation
- provide network access to other parties
- provide SSO and more
- 3rd-parties can establish a federated network
	- auth and authorize between two orgs
	- login with your FB credentials
- 3rd-parties must establish a trust reslationship and degree of trust

SAML (Secure Assertion Markup Language)
- Open standard for authentication and authorization
- you can authenticate through 3rd-party to gain access
- Shibboleth, open-source, implements SAML to provide federated SSO
- not originally designed for mobile apps

OAuth
- authorization framework
- created by Twitter, Google etc.. significant industry support > popular
- not an authentication protocol
	- OpenID Connect handles the SSO authentication
	- OAuth provides authorization between apps
