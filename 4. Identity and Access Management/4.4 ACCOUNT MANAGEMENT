4.4 ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT

Account Types

User accounts
- account on computer associated with a specific person
- computer associates user with a specific identification number
- storage/files can be private to that user, even if another user in PC
- no privileged access to OS
- most common account

Shared and generic accounts
- Guest login, anonymous login
- difficult to create audit trail
- difficult to determine proper privileges
- PW management becomes difficult
- should be avoided

Service accounts
- used exclusively by services running on a computer
- no interactive/user access (ideally)
- web serve, db server etc.
- access can be defined for a specific service
	- web server right/permissions different than db server
- commonly use username and PW
	- determine best policy for PW updates

Privileged accounts
- elevated access to one or more systems (admin,root)
- complete access to system
	- often used to manage hw, drivers, sw installation
- should not be used for normal administration
- needs to be highly secured
	- strong PW, 2FA, scheduled pw changes

Account Management

Least privilege
- rights/permissions should be bare minimum
	- only get what's needed to complete your objective
- all user accounts must be limited, apps should be running with min. privileges
- don't allow users to run with admin privileges, limits scope of malicious behaviour

On-boarding
- bring new person into the org
- IT agreements need to be signed, handbook or separate AUP
- create accounts, associate user with proper groups
- provide req IT hw: laptop, tablet etc, preconfigured and ready to go

Off-boarding
- process should be pre-planned
- what happens to hw, data
- account info usually deactivated (not always deleted)

Perform routine audits
- policy followed?
- things can change
- certain action can be automatically identified
	- consider tool for log analysis

Auditing
- permission auditing
	- correct permissions?
	- some admins don't need to be there
	- scheduled recertification
- usage auditing
	- how are resources used?
	- systems and apps secure?
- time-of-day restriction
	- nobody needs to acces to X at X clock

Standard naming convention
- Unique: username shouldn't conflict with another, same accross systems
- Consistent: shouldn't describe role/status
- Persistent: same username for the duration of employment
- Memorable: ez to remember, doesn't mean recognizable

Account maintenance
- account createion: initial provisioning, pw management, group/permission assignments
- Periodic updates: pw reset, forced updates, audits
- Deprovisioning: disable account, archive user doc and encryption keys

Group-based access control
- set privileges based on what you do
	- many users in single group, set privileges on the group
- users can belong to multiple groups
	- group permissions can overlap
	- how to determine effective permissions?
		- not easy
		- implicit permissions can cause problems

Location-based policies
- user access based on location
	- gps, very accurate
	- 802.11 wireless, less accurate
	- IP, not accurate
- restrict app use
- apply security rules
	- your IP is associated with IP block in China
	- we don't have office in China
	- permission not granted

Account Policy Enforcement

Credential management
- all that stands between the outside world and all of the data
- PW must not be embedded in the app
	- everything needs to reside on server, not client
- comms should be encrypted, authentication traffic should be impossible to see

Configuring settings
- Windows Group Policy Management
	- apply sec and admin setting across many PCs
- different than NTFS or Share permissions: control use of OS
- Linked to AD administrative boundaries (sites, domain, OUs, groups, locations etc.)

Group Policy control
- administrative policies
	- remove/add program
	- prohibit X, allow Y
- sec policies
	- specify min PW length
	- max sec log size
	- enforce user login restrictions

PW complexity and length
- no single words, no obvious pw
- mix upper/lower case, use special characters, don't replace o with 0
- strong PW atleast 8 charactes, consider phrase or set of words
- prevent PW reuse, system remembers PW history, req unique pws

PW expiration and recovery
- all should expire (30, 60, 90 days)
- critical systems might change more freq
- recovery process should not be trivial

Account lockout and disablement
- too many wrong PW will cause lockout
- should be normal for most users
	- might cause issues for service accounts, but notice bruteforce
- disable accounts instead of deleting them
