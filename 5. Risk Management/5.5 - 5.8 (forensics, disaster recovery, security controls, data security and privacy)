5.5 FORENSICS

Gathering Forensics Data

Forensic procedures
- Collect and protect info relating to intrusion
- standard digital forensic process
	- acquisition, analysis, reporting
- detail oriented, extensive notes

Order of volatility
- some media is much more volatile (CPU cahce vs Archival media)
- gather data in order from most to less volatile

Chain of custody
- control evidence, maintain integrity
- everyone who contacts the evidence, avoid tampering (use hashes)
- label and catalog, seal and store

Legal hold
- legal technique to preserve relevant info
	- prepare for impending litigation
	- initiated by legal counsel
- hold notification
	- records custodians instructed to preserve data
- separate repo for ESI (electronically stored info)
- ongoing preservation
	- once notified, ongoing obligation to preserve data

Capture system image
- copy contents of a disk
	- bit-for-bit, byte-for-byte
	- get every morsel of info
- sw imaging tools, use bootable device
- remove the physical drive
	- use hw write-blocker
- get backup tapes

Network traffic and logs
- FW, lot of info
- switch/router don't usually log user-lvl info
- IPS, traffic patterns
- raw network traffic data
	- stream-to-disk
	- rebuild images, emails, browser sessions, file transfers

Capture video
- moving record of the event
- capture status of the screen and volatile info (mobile phone)
- security cameras and your phone
- video content must also be archived, may be important

Recording time offsets
- document local device settings
- different file systems store timestamps differently
- record time offset from the OS

Take hashes
- to avoid tampering
- MD5 (Message Digest 5)
	- 128 bits
- CRC (Cyclical Redundancy Check)
	- 32 bits
- Create MD5 hash for image, file...
	- data can be verified

Screenshots
- difficult to reproduce
- external capture, camera/phone
- internal capture, printscreen

Witnesses
- who might have seen this?
- interview and document, be quick
- not 100% accurate

Using Forensics Data

Preservation
- lot of data, important for investigation
- may be future investigation, revisit incidents
- new items may be discovered

Recovery
- strategic intelligence
	- collect and process info
	- base sec policy changes on this 
- counterintelligence gathering
	- what we know about attacker?
	- learn habits
- active logging
	- log everything, everywhere
	- track attackers steps

Track man hours and expenses
- some incidents can use massive resources
	- all at once
- may impact the bottom line
- may be req for restitution (be accurate)

5.6 DISASTER RECOVERY

Disaster Recovery Sites

Cold site
- no hw, empty building
- no data, no pepople

Warm site
- somewhere between cold/hot
- bring the hw OR hw is ready, bring data

Hot site
- exact replica, everything duplicated
- constantly updated, you buy 2 of everything
- apps/sw constantly updated, automated replication
- flip a switch and everything moves

---

Application Recovery

Order of restoration
- some more important than others, client-facing etc.
- list should be defined by management
- order may change based on calendar

Backup strategies
- tape, disk, optical
- db backups: replication, online dublicates
	- online backups, specialized for db
- email db backups: provide server, db, mailxob or msg backup/restore
- snapshots: OS volume or hypervisor
- system backups: bare metal backup using images

File backups
- the archive attribut: set when a file is modified
- full: everything, you'll want this first
- incremental: all files changed since the last incremental backup
- differential: all files changed since tha last full bu

---

Geographic Considerations

Selecting offiste recovery options
- your building can be the disaster: fire,flood, tornado
- hedge your bets by keeping data offsite
- recovery site can host you in different location
	- get up running quickly

Off-site backups
- vaulting
	- send BU data outside storage facility
	- E-vaulting - send data electronically
- org-owned or 3rd-party, usually secure
- BUs req extensive protection, data loss/theft is concern
- many compliance mandates (SOX, HIPAA, FISMA)

Distance
- balancing act, recovery vs accessibility
- rec site should be outside scope of disaster, but close enough

Location selection
- legal implications
- business regulations vary
- refer to your legal team
- data sovereignty, where is your data stored? Subject to that countrys laws

---

Continuity of Operations

Tabletop exercises
- full scale disaster drill costly and time consuming
- many of the logistics can be determined through analysis
- key players together for tabletop exercise, simulate disaster

The scope of tabletop exercie
- decide complexity, inhouse or local first responders?
- scope of disaster, water break or death?
- involve everyone, make a suprise
- exercise should find the gaps

After-action reports (AAR)
- exercise scope and obj
- methodology, detailed explanation of the exercise
- what worked, what not?
- next steps, update procedures

Failover
- recovery site is prepped, data in sync
- business failover to alt processing site
- revert back to primary location, process must be documented for both directions

Alternate business practices
- not everything goes like planned
- we rely on computer systems, needs to be alternative
	- manual transaction, paper receipts, phone calls
- must be documented

5.7 Security Controls

- Many diff sec risks/types
- assets vary: data, property, computer systems
- sec controls prevent sec events, minimize impact, limit damage

Control types
- Technical control type
	- controls implemented using systmes, OS controls
- Administrative
	- determine how people act, sec policies, standard operating procedures
- Physical
	- Fences, locks, mantraps, real-world sec

Security controls
- Deterrent
	- may not prevent but discourages, warnings
- Preventive
	- physically control access, lock, FW
- Detective
	- may not prevent access, motion sensor, IDS/IPS
- Compensating
	- doesn't prevent attack, restores, hot-site, bu power system
- Corrective
	- designed to mitigate dmg, IPS can block, BU can mitigate ransomware

5.8 DATA SECURITY AND PRIVACY

Data Destruction

Data Destruction and media sanitization
- disposal becomes legal issue, some info must not be destroyed
- no critical info to the trash (dumpster dive)
- reuse the storage media, sanitize before, ensure nothing left

Protect your rubbish
- secure garbage, fence and lock
- shred documents, burning better
- pulp the paper, large washing tank to remove ink > paper recycled

Physical destruction
- shredder / pulverizer
	- heavy machinery, complete destruction
- Drill/hammer, quick and easy
- Electromagnetic (degaussing)
	- remove the magnetic field, destroys the drive data and electronics
	- Incineration, fire

Certificate of destruction
- destruction often done by 3rd party
- need verification that data is destroyed
- paper trail of broken data, know exactly what happened

Sanitizing media
- purge data: remove it from existing data store, delete some of db
- wipe data
	- unrecoverable removal of data
	- usually overwrites data storage locations
	- useful when need to reuse media

Data security
- don't fully trust 3rd-parties
- file level overwriting
	- Sdelete - windows sysinternals
- whole drive wipe secure data removal
	- DBAN - Dariks Boot and Nuke
- Physical drive destruction
	- one-off or industrial removal and destroy

Handling Sensitive Data

- not all data has same lvl of sensitivity
	- license tag numbers vs health records
- diff lvl req diff security and handling
	- additional permissions
	- diff process to view
	- restricted network access

Data sensitivity labels
- public / unclassified
	- no restrictions
- Private / Classified / Restriced / Internal use only
	- restricted access, may req NDA
- Confidential
	- very sensitive, must be approved to view

Sensitive data types
- Proprietary
	- property of orgs
	- may inclued trade secrets
	- often data uniq to org
- PII - Personally Identifiable Information
	- name, date of birth, biometric info...
- PHI - Protected Health Information
	- health status, care recodes...

---

Data Roles and Retention

Data roles
- high-lvl data relationships
	- organizational responsibilities, not always technical
- data owner
	- accountable of specific data, often senior offices
	- VP of Sales owns customer relationship data etc.
- data steward
	- responsible for data accuracy, privacy and sec
	- associates sensitivity labels to data
	- ensures compliance with laws and standards
- data custodian
	- manages access rights to data
	- implements sec controls
	- sometimes same person as steward
- Privacy offices
	- responsible for orgs data privacy
	- sets policies, implements processes and procedures

Data retention
- keep files that change freq for version control
	- files change often, keep BU like a week
- recover from virus infection
	- infection may not be identififed immediately
	- may need to retain 30 days of BU
- consider legal req for data retention
	- email storage may be req over years
	- some industries must legally store certain data types
	- diff data types, diff storage req
		- corp tax info, customer PII, tape backups...
