5.1 Security Policies

Agreement Types

Standard operating procedure
-important processes to maintain data and system sec
	- detail routine operations, usually quite extensive
-day-to-day processes
	-new account, backup data storage req, encryption key req
-these should be well documented
	-comply with industry regulations

Interoperability agreements
- 3rd-party and outsourced services
	- the legal side of info-tech
- web hosting, payroll services, fw management etc.
	- some of your data in hands of others
	- what access controls in place?
- include legal department with these agreements

Common agreements
- Service Level Agreement (SLA)
	- min terms for service provider
	- uptime, response time agreement etc.
- Business Partners Agreement (BPA)
	- commonly between manufacturers and resellers
- Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA)
	- Used by US Federal Gov to define sec controls
- Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
	- both side agree
	- usually include statement of confidentiality
	- informal letter of intent, not a signed contract
- Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
	- next step above MOU, both agree objectives
	- legal document, even without legal language
	- unlike contract, may not conatin legally enforceable promises

Personnel Management

Business policies
- Mandatory vacations, the longer vacation > better chance to identify fraud, especially in high-sec environments
- job rotation, no one person maintain control for long period
- separation of duties: split knowledge, half a safe combination
- dual control: two people need to be present
- clean desk policy: when you leave your desk, nothing is on your desk
	- limit exposure to sensitive data

Background checks
- pre-employment screening, verify applicants claims
- discover criminal history etc.

Adverse actions
- action that denies employment based on the background check
- can also include existing employees

Personnel security procedures
- NDA (non-disclosure agreement)
	- confidentiality agreement /legal contract
	- prevents use of info
- onboarding
	- induction/training
	- usually formal process
- continuing education
	- sec is constantly changing

Acceptable use policies (AUP)
- what is acceptable use of company assets
	- documentation, may be in Rules of Behavior
- covers internet use, telephones, PCs, etc.
- used by org to limit legal liability
	- if someone is dismissed, well-documented reasons why

5.2 Business Impact Analysis

Recovery
- Mean time to restore (MTTR)
	- mean time to repair
- Mean time to failure (MTTF)
	- the expected lifetime of a non-repairable product/system
- Mean time between failures (MTBF)
	- predict time between failures
- Recovery time objectives (RTO)
	- get up running quickly and particular service level
- Recovery point objectives (RPO)
	- how much data loss acceptable
	- bring system back online, how far back data goes?

Calculating uptime and availability
- % - 5 nines - 99,999%
- "Availability" is negotiated definition
	- especially if it's part of your bonus

- 99,9999 	00.00:32 downtime
- 99,999		00:05:15
- 99,99			00:52:34
- 99,9			08:45:36
- 99				87:36:00


Mission-essential functions
- if hurricane, where you start your analysis, broad business req
- what computing systems are required for these mission-essential business functions? Identify critical systems

Removing single point of failure
- single event can ruin your day, if no plans
- networking configuration
	- multiple devices (the Noahs Ark of networking)
- Facility/Utilities
	- backup power
- People/location
	- hurricane can disrupt personnel travel
- no practical way to remove all points of failure

Impact
- Life: the most important
- Property: risk to buildings/assets
- Safety: some environments too dangerous to work
- Finance: the resulting financial cost
- Reputation: event can cause status/character problems

Privacy Compliance
- some compliance req a public privacy statement
- Privacy threshold analysis (PTA)
	- 1st step in compliance process
	- identify business processes that are privacy-sensitive
	- determine if PIA is req
- Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)
	- ensures compliance with privacy laws and regulations
	- what PII is collected/why
	- how PII data collected,used,secured

5.3 Risk Assessment

Threat assessments
- Environmental: tornado, hurricane..
- Man-made: internal/external, employees/outside orgs

Quantitative risk calculation
- likelihood
- Annualized Rate of Occurrence (ARO)
	- how likely hurricane will hit? In Montana? Florida?
- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)
	- laptop stolen = 1000$
- Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)
	- ARO x SLE
	- 7 laptops lost a year = 7000$
- The business impact can be more than monetary
	- quantitative vs qualitative

Evaluating risk
- Risk register
	- every project has a plan, also risk
	- identify and document the risks
	- apply possible solutions and monitor results
- Supply chain assessment
	- get a product or service from supplier to cu
	- evaluate coordination between groups
	- identify areas of improvement, asses the IT systems supporting the operation
	- document the business process changes

Qualitative risk assessment
- identify significant risk factors
- ask opinions about significance
- display visually with traffic light grid or similar method

Business impact analysis
- critical business functions
- what is impacted: revenye, legal req, customers
- how long impacted: need personnel, equipment, resources?
- impact to the bottom line: disaster recovery good investment?

Testing for risk
- many servers contain sensitive data
- running vuln and pentest can cause outages
- formal authorization
	- remove legal liability from testing

Risk response techniques
- Risk-avoidance: stop participating in high-risk activity
- Transference: buy insurance
- Acceptance: take the risk
- Mitigation: decrease risk level, invest in sec systems

Change management
- how to upgrade sw, change fw confs etc.
- one of the most common risks in enterprise
- often overlooked or ignored
- have clear policies: freq, duration, installtion process, fallback
- sometimes difficult to implement

5.4 Incident Response

Incident Response Planning

Sec incidents
- user click email attachment and executer malware
- DDoS
- Conf info is stolen
- user install p2p and uses it

Incident categories, examples
- External/removable media
- Attrition: brute-force attack
- Web: attack from web site or web based app
- Email: attack from email attachment
- Improper usage: attack resulted from violation of Acceptable Use Policy
- Loss/theft of equipment
- Other

Roles and responsibilities
- Incident response team
	- specialized group, trained and tested
- IT security management
	- corporate support
- Compliance officers
	- Intricate knowledge of compliance rules
- Technical staff
- User community, they see everything

Incident notification
- Contact list
- Corporate / Org: CIO / Head of Info Sec / Internal Response Teams
- Internal non-IT: HR, PA, Legal dep
- External contacts: system owner, law enforc, US-CERT

CIRT (Cyber-incident response team)
- Receives, reviews and responds
- Determine what type of events require a CIRT response (virus, ransomw, DDoS?)
- CIRT may or may not be part of org structure (as-needed basis)
- Focuses on incident handling (response, analysis, reporting)

Exercise
- Test before actual event, scheduled update sessions
- rules of engagement, do not touch production
- very specific scenario
- evaluate response: document and discuss

Incident Response Process

NIST SP800-61 (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
- Computer Security Incident Handling Guide
- Incident response lifecycle:
	- preparation
	- detection and analysis
	- containment, eradication and recovery
	- post-incident activity

Preparing for incident
- comm methods, contacts
- incident handling hw and sw: laptops, forensic softw
- incident analysis resources: documentation, network diagrams..
- mitigation software: clean OS and app images
- policies needed for incident handling: everyone knows their roles

The challenge of detection
- many different detection sources
- much white noise, attacks coming all the time
- incidents almost always complex

Incident precursors
- heads up, incident might occur
- logs
- exploit announcements
- direct threats (hacking group, twitter)

Incident indicators
- buffer overflow attempts, identified by IPS
- AV alarms
- Host-based monitor detects conf changes
- Network traffic flows deviate from the norm

Isolation and containment
- sandboxes
- isolation can be problematic
	- malware checks
	- if notices sandbox, everything deleted/encrypted/damaged

Recovery after an incident
- eradicate the bug
	- remove malware
	- disable breached accounts
	- fix vulns
- recover the system
	- restore backups, rebuild from scratch, replace files
	- tighten down the perimeter

Reconstitution
- phased approach, hard to fix all at once
- recovery may take months
- plan should be efficient
	- start with quick, high-value sec changes (patch, fw policy)
	- later phases involve "heavier lifting" (infra changes..)

Lessons learned
- learn and improve
- post-incident meeting
- don't wait too long	
- what happened? timestamps
- how incident plans work?
- what to do better?
- which indicators to watch next time?
