3.1 SECURITY FRAMEWORKS


Compliance and Frameworks

Compliance
- meeting standard of laws, policies and regulations
- catalog of rules, many industry-specific
- penalties (fines, incarceration, loss of employment)
- domestic and international req

Regulatory
- Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
	- The Public Company Accounting reform and Investor Protection Act of 2002
- The Health Insurance Protability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
	- Extensive healthcare standard on health care info

Non-regulatory
- no law, strongly suggested, law maybe coming
- AV signature sharing, malicious IP sharing

Frameworks
- structure and organization, process management, best practices (guidelines, cost effective), training

Industry-specific frameworks
-ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)
-multiple stages of the IT lifecycle
-service design, transition, operation, strategy, improvement

Secure Configuration Guides

-default confs usually not secure
-hardening guides to softwares or platforms

Web server hardening
-Apache, IIS (MS Internet Information Server)
-data leaks, server access
-info leakage: banner, directory browsing
-permissions: run from non-admin account, conf file permissions
-SSL: manage and install certs
-monitor access and error logs

OS hardening
-updates: service packs, sec patches
-user accounts: min pw lengt/complexity, limitations
-network access/sec: limit access
-monitor and secure: av

Application server
-programming languages, runtime libraries etc.
-usually between web server and db
-middleware
-very specific functionality (disable unnecessary services)
-sec patches, file permissions and access controls

Network infrastructure devices
- switches, routers, FWs, IPS etc.
- purpose built device, embedded OS
- conf authentication (dont use defaults)
- check with manufacturer: sec updates important

---

Defense-in-Depth

Layering the defence
-physical controls: fences, locks, cameras
-technical controls: hw/software,  FW, AD, auth, disk encrpt
-admin controls: policies/procedures, backup media handling

-FW, DMZ, Hashing/salting PW, Authentication, IPS/IDS, VPN, card/badge, AV, sec guard

3.2 SECURING THE NETWORK

SECURE NETWORK TOPOLOGIES

DMZ (Demilitarized zone)
- layer of sec between inet and you
- public access to public resources

Extranet
- private network for partners (vendors, suppliers)0
- authentication required

Intranet
- Private network, only internally
- company announcements, important documents, employees only
- no external access, internal/VPN only

Wireless networking
- separate network for guests
- user auth to internal wireless network
- 802.1X standard
- no shared PW for internal wireless

Guest network
- no access to internal network, only inet
- captive portal

Ad hoc
- AirDrop, contact sharing apps
- difficult to control unmanaged devices
- implemetn access control

Honeypots and honeynets
- single-use/system traps or many honeypots on a network

NAT - Network Address Translation
- IPv4 supports aroun 4.29 billion addresses
- IPv4 exhausted
- not security mechanism, no protection, security through obscurity
- can circumvent unprotected NAT (attacks assume NAT is there)
- stateful FW in conjunction with NAT to provide sec

---

Network Segmentation

-Physical, logical, virtual segmentation
	- devices, vlans, virtual networks
- performance
- security, only apps in core are SQL/SSH, users not directly talking to DB servers
- compliance, mandated segmentation, change control easier

Physical segmentation
- devices physically separate, switch/customer A and B
- must be connected to provide comms

Logical segmentation with VLANs
- Virtual Local Area Networks
- separated logically, not physically
- cannot communicate between VLANs without layer 3 device

Virtualization
- all devices virtualized
- instant and complete control
	- build new network, route between IP subnets, drop FW between, drag/drop devices between networks

Air gaps
- one step farther vs physical segmentation
- remove any conncetivity between components (no shared components)
- Network separation, Industrial systems (SCADA, manufacturing)
- some tech can jump the gap (removable media)

---

VPN technologies

Site-to-Site VPNs
- encrypt traffic between sites, through public Inet
- use existing Inet connection, with VPN appliances

Host-to-Site VPNs
- also called "remote access VPN"
- req software on user device (may be built-in OS)

Host-to-Host VPNs
- user to user encryption, software based, no hw needed

---

Security Technology Placement

Sensors and collectors
- gather info from network devices
- built-in sensors, separate devices
- integrated to switch, router, server, FW etc.

Sensors
- IPS, FW, DB, auth, web server access logs

Collectors
- Proprietary consoles (IPS,FW), SIEM, syslog servers

Filters and FWs
- packet filters
	- simple data blocks - ingores state
	- linux iptables - filter apckets in the kernel
	- usually placed on device/server
- FWs
	- state based
	- advanced filtering (IP,port,app,content)
	- usually on ingress/egress of network
	- some between internal networks

Proxy servers
- intermediate server
- performs request for user and provides results back to client 
- access control, caching, url filtering, content scanning

Forward proxy
- protect users from Inet

VPN concentrators
- VPN appliance usually located on the edge of network (internet-facing)

SSL accelerators
- SSL handshake requires CPU power, offload to HW like Load balancer

Load balancers
- manage load across multiple devices
- performs constant health checks

DDoS mitigation
- resist DDoD, minize impact
- Cloud-based, inet provider or reverse proxy service
- On-site tools, DDoS filtering in FW/IPS
- positioned between you and the internet

Aggregation switches
- core <> distribution and aggregation <> access

Taps and port mirrors
- intercept network traffic, send copy to packet capture device
- physical tap: disconnect link, put tap in middle
- can be active or passive tap
- port mirror
	- port redirection, SPAN (Switched Port ANalyzer)
	- software-based tap

---

Securing SDN

Software Defined Networking
- networking devices have 2 functional planes of operation
	- control plane, data plane
- directly programmable: configuration different than forwarding
- agile: changes can be made dynamically
- centrally managed: global view, single console
- programmatically configured: orchestration, no human intervention
- open standards / vendor netural : standard interface to the network

3.3 SECURE SYSTEMS DESIGN


Hardware Security

Full Disk Encryption (FDE) - bitlocker, luks
- encrypt entire drive, OS too, data always protected

TPM - Trusted Platform Module
- hw to help with encryption stuff
- cryptographic processor: rng, key generators
- persisten memory: uniq keys burned in
- versatile memory: sotrage keys, hw conf info 
- pw protected: no dictionary attacks

HSM - Hardware Security Module
- high-end cryptographic hw - plug in card or hw device
- key backup, crypto accelerator

Hardware root of trust
- security is based on trust: data safely encrypted? web site legit?
- trust has to start somewhere: TPM,HSM > root of trus
- difficult to change or avoid, wont work without hw

UEFI BIOS
- Unified Extensible Firmware Interface
- based on Intels EFI
- defined standard, designed to replace legacy BIOS

Secure boot
- malicious software can "own" your system
- parf of the UEFI
- digitally sign known-good software
	- won't run without proper signature
- support in many OS: win, linux, Apple's own EFI

Remote attestation
- nothing on workstation has changed? HW/Software
- device reports operational report to verification server
- encrypted/signed with TPM
- changes identified and managed before OS booted

Supply chain
- Some Cisco routers were infected with modified firmware with backdoor access
- use trusted vendors, critical devices should not be connected to the outside and hw needs bo verified

EMI/EMP
- Electromagnetic interference / pulse
- EMI leakage: determine data streams based on EMI emissions, keyboards, HDD, network connections
- modify security by injectin EMI, change sensor data and other input
- shielding against EMP important for national sec and infrastr

Operating System Security

-Network
	-supports servers, workstations, other network connected dev
-Server: web, db server
-Workstation: optimized for user apps: email, browsing, office
-Appliance: purpose-built, minimal OS, often unseen
-Kiosk: public device, OS tightly locked
-MobileOS: optimized for mobile hw

Patch management
-system stability, sec fixes
-service packs, all at once
-monthly updates, incremental
-emergency out-of-band updates: 0-day and high sec discoveries

Update options
-Windows update
-WSUS - Windows server update services - centralized mngmt
-MacOS App store
-Linux: many options: yum,apt-get,rpm, gui

The patching process
- not always seamless, takes planning
- may introduce problems
- don't have to install every single patch
- often centrally managed, test all your apps, then deploy, manage bandwidth

Disabling unnecessary services
- every service potential for trouble, like 0-day
- not always obvious, win10 has over 240 by default
- takes time, trial and error, monitoring

Least functionality
- limit OS to only what's needed
- every function is potential sec risk
- depending on use: shipping vs IT dev vs Kios
- extensive confs: disable printer, ability to change, log on as a service

Secure configurations
- fine tuning of OS
- secure conf policies
	- stay updated with latest patches
	- compromised are re-imaged
	- changes go trhough change management
	- regular integrity checks

Evaluation Assurance Level
- Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation
- also called as Common Criteria (CC)
- Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 1-7
- trusted operating system is EAL compliant (4 minimum accepted)

Application whitelisting/blacklisting
- any app can be malicious
- security policy can control app execution
- whitelisting: nothing runs unless approved
- blacklisting: nothing on list can execute
- decisions made in OS
	- app hash, cert, path, network zone

Disabling unnecessary accounts
- all OS include other accs
	- guest, root, mail, etc.
- disable unnecessary/interactive logins

Peripheral Security

Wireless kb/mouse
- many communicate in clear, 2.4GHz
- easy to capture keystrokes with a receiver
- or inject keystroker and control remotely
- some kb support AES encryption

Displays
- electromagnetic radiation
- view info on a screen by eavesdropping EM signals
- internal signals of laptop or cable, through walls
- firmware hacks
	- many displays have nos sec for firmw upgrades

Wifi-enabled microSD cards
- SD card auth vulns
- predictable access, easy to read files overe wifi
- API access to SD card
	- can result in data leakage/loss if no strong sec

Printers/multi-funcion devices
- printer, scanner, fax, network connectivity, local storage
- reconnaissance, log files for activity, address books
- unauthorized access
- gather info, capture spool file

External storage devices
- limited auth, always use file/volume encryption
- often used to exfiltration of data

Digital cameras
- camera firmware can be compromised, like security camera

3.4 SECURE DEPLOYMENTS

Development to production
- Patch tuesday, like in Windows
- manage the process, safely move from non-prod to production 

Sandboxing
- isolated testing environment
- safe space, no connection to real world or production system
- try some code, break some code
- incremental development, helps build the app

Working environments
- development
	- secure, writing code, devs test in their sandboxes
Test
- still in development state, all pieces put togethers, works?
- functional tests, QA testing
- if ok here > ready for staging
Staging
- copy of production, run perf/usability tests, 
Production
- app is live to user community

Secure baselines
- sec of app environment well defined
- all app instances must follow baseline
- FW settings, patch levels, OS file versions
- may req constant updates
- Integrity measurements check for sec baseline
	- often, chack against well-documented baselines, failure req correction

	- non-trivial systems, need always be available, difficult to know what sec in place

Printers, scanners, fax machines
- All-in-one or multifunction devices (MFD)
- very sophisticated firmware
- might store images/logs locally on device

Camera systems
- video monitoring for home/office
- IP devices > privacy concerns

Special purpose
