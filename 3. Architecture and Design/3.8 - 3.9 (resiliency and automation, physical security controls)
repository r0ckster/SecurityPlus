3.8 RESILIENCY AND AUTOMATION

Automation and scripting
- plan for change, implement automatically
- many problems can be predicted, set automated responses
- continuous monitoring
- cloud-based technologies allow for constant change
- automatically validate a config before going live
- perform automated checks, vuln scans

Templates
- cloud orchestration relies on templates
- blueprint of your online service
- template just the start
	- each app instance needs to be customized
	- orchestrate with scripts and APIs

Master image
- instead of building server each time, create customized image
- still need to make changes: ip, fw rules, license
- master image needs to be up to date
	- sec patches, OS/service updates
	- can be administratively challenging
	- can also save time

Non-persistence
- cloud always in motion
- snapshots can capture current configuration and data
	- preserve complete state of device or just conf
- revert to known state
- rollback to known configuration (dont modify data)
- live boot media, run OS on removable media

Elasticity and scalability
-Elasticity
	- provide resources when demand req it and scale down when not needed
-host availability, new servers deployed 1-click
-virtualization integrates a layer of orchestration
	- automate deployment/movement of virtual hosts
- servers can be added or moved to other data centers
	- all management systems follow the servers

Redundancy, Fault Tolerance and High Availability

Distributive allocation
- need many devices t maintain application instance
	- web servers, db servers, middleware, sec devices etc.
- don't keep all in one place
	- critical assets, data should be in different places
	- easier to add sec between and segmented areas
	- makes it more difficult to target and exploit

Reduncancy and fault tolerance
- maintain uptime, org continues to function
- no HW failure, servers keep running
- no sw failure, services always available
- no system failure, network performing optimaly

Redundant hw components
- multiple devices, load balancing power supplies
RAID
- Redundat Array of Independent Disks
UPS (Uninterruptible power supplies)
- prepare for power disconnections
Clustering
- logical collective of servers
Load balancing
	- shared service load across components

RAID 0 - striping without parity - high perf, no faul tolerance
RAID 1 - mirroring - duplicates data for fault tolerance, req 2x disk space
RAID 5 - striping with parity - fault tolerant, req additional disk for redundancy
RAID 0+1, 1+0 5+1 etc - Multiple RAID types - combine methods to increase dedundancy

High availability (HA)
- always on, always available
- redundancy doens't always mean always available
- may inclued many different components working together
- watch for single points of failure

3.9 PHYSICAL SECURITY CONTROLS

Proper lighting
- more light = more sec
- non IR cam see better
- specialized design
	- angels (facial recognition), avoid shadows and glare

Signs
- clear and specific instrucitons, consider visitors
- personal safety: frie exits, warning signs, medical resources
- informational: in case of emergency, call this

Fencing
- build a permitere, trasparent or paque
- robust, prevent climbing

Rack monitoring and sec
- environmental sensors, webcams, integration with enerprise monitoring systems
- security: closed racks, locks, fences and gates

Guards and access list
- sec guard: physical protection, validates identification
- ID badge, must be worn at all times
- access list: physcial list of names, enforced by sec guard

Alarms
- Circuit-based, opened or closed
- door window fence, useful on the perimeter
- motion detection: radio reflection or passive infrared
	- useful in areas not often used
- duress: triggered by a person, big red button

Safe
- sec your hw/media: backups, laptops, hdds
- protection against elements: fire,water
- difficult to steal, very heavy
- manage carefully: what happens when you lose combination

Locking cabinets
- data center hw often managed by different groups
	- responsibility lies with the owner
- some may need more ventilation

Protected distribution System (PDS)
- physically secured cabled network
- all of the data flows through these conduits
- prevents direct and inductive taps
- prevent cable and fiber cuts, pysical DoS
- hardened PDS
	- sealed metal conduit, periodic visual inspection

Air gap
- physical separation between neworks (airplane, nuclear power plant)
- most environments are shared and virtualized

Faraday cage
- blocks electromagnetic fields
- windows of microwave oven
- not a comprehensive solution: not all signal types are blocked
- restricts access to mobile network: how to make emergency calls?

Door access controls
- conventional: lock/key
- deadboldt: physical bolt
- Electronic: keyless
- token-based: magnetic swipe card or proximity reader
- multi-factor: smard card and PIN

Biometrics
- authentication: fingerprint, iris, voiceprint
- usually stores mathematical representation of your biometric
	- actual fingerprint is not usually saved
- difficult to change: PW vs fingerprint
- used in very specifi situations, not foolproof

Barricades / bollards
- prevent access, channel people through a specific access point
	- allow people, prevent cars
- identify safety concerns and prevent injuries
- cna be used to an extreme (concrete barriers / bollards, moats)

Tokens and cards
- smart card: integrates with devices, may req PIN
- USB token, cert is on USB
- HW/SW tokens: generates pseudo-random auth codes
- your phone, SMS code

HVAC (Heating, Ventilatin and Air Conditioning)
- data center should be separate from the rest of the building
- closed-loop recirculating and positive pressurization
	- recycle internal air
- Hot and cold aisles

Fire suppression
- electronics require unique responses to fire (water is bad)
- detection: smoke, flame, heat detector
- use water where appropriate
- suppress with chemicals (FM-200)

Cable locks
- temporary sec, connect your hw to something solid
- useful when mobile, most devices have a standard connector
- not designed for long-term solution

Video surveillance
- CCTV (Closed circuit television)
- folac length - shorter is wider angle
- depth of field - how much is in focus
- illumination req - see in the dark

Logs
- everything is logged
- entering the parking area >
